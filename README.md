# Connectivity Library
Open source repository where we can share all our knowledge around connectivity capabilities for Coveo's platform.

**Note: This repository is not meant to be used directly from your machine, but for its examples to be copied and pasted directly in your [Coveo Platform](http://platform.cloud.coveo.com/).**

## Before you start:
Learn more about Coveo's connectivity options [here](https://docs.coveo.com/en/1702/cloud-v2-administrators/add-or-edit-a-source-using-one-of-the-available-connectors). 
In there you will understand how Coveo index different systems, and you will find a list with all systems Coveo can connect with (using a Coveo connector or a Generic connector).

In this Repo you will find examples of repositories/systems that have been indexed using Coveo *Generic Rest API Connector*. However, this list isn’t exhaustive. If you want to index a repository/system that doesn’t appear in this repository, you can probably do so thanks to a [Generic Connector](https://docs.coveo.com/en/1702/cloud-v2-administrators/add-or-edit-a-source-using-one-of-the-available-connectors#generic-connectors).

### Requirements:
To use these examples you must have:
* A Coveo platform organization
* Basic knowledge on [how to configure a Generic REST API Connector](https://docs.coveo.com/en/1896/cloud-v2-administrators/add-or-edit-a-generic-rest-api-source)
