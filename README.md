In there you will understand how Coveo index different systems, and you will find a list with all systems Coveo can connect with (using a Coveo connector or a Generic connector).

In this Repo you will find examples of repositories/systems have been indexed using Coveo *Generic Rest API Connector*. However, this list isn’t exhaustive. If you want to index a repository/system that doesn’t appear in this repository, you can probably do so thanks to a [Generic Connector](https://docsstaging.coveo.com/DOC-7689-Platform-NewConnectorsList/1702/cloud-v2-administrators/add-or-edit-a-source-using-one-of-the-available-connectors#generic-connectors)

**Requirements:**
To use these examples you have to:
* Have a Coveo platform organization
* Have basic knowledge on [[how to configure a Generic REST API Connector](https://docs.coveo.com/en/1896/cloud-v2-administrators/add-or-edit-a-generic-rest-api-source)
